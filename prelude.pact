\ Defined the comment word, now we can talk.

\ The definition of the ; word is hairy. It needs to define itself while
\ there's still not the full word defining machinery present, and it also
\ needs to do immediate word stuff. So first you add the LIT EXIT , bit where
\ the ; word will compile the terminating EXIT instruction to the word
\ definition on which it's being called. Then you exit the current compile
\ mode and go back to intepreting with [, this happens here in the interpreter
\ state, not in the code of ;. Then you compile the [ operation into the
\ definition of ; with ' [ ,. Then the actual EXIT for ; itself, (not the word
\ that ; will terminate later) with ' exit , (since we're still defining ; and
\ can't use it here to end the definition yet). Finally tag ; as an immediate
\ word.
